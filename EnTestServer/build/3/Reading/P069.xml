   <title>A very nice holiday</title>

   <paragraph>Mr. and Mrs. Gray live in a big city. They have only a son. His name is Peter. Peter does not like washing his hands. One summer they go to a small town for a holiday. They live in a small house.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>When they arrive at the house, Mrs. Gray tells Peter, "We will stay here for two weeks."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>The boy runs into the house and looks round all the rooms, and then he runs back to his mother and says to her, "I find no bathtub here, mum. Where is it?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"This is a very small house, Peter," his mother says, "and there is no bathtub."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"That's very good." Peter says happily. "There is going to be a very nice holiday."</paragraph>
