   <title>A careless grandfather</title>

   <paragraph>My name is John. My grandfather is very careless. He is a very clever man, but he never remembers little things.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>April 27th is my birthday. My grandfather says to me, "I'm going to your home and give you a present!" I'm very excited. I wait for him all day, but he doesn't come, so I phone him and ask why. He answers, "Sorry, I went to the other grandson's home."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>What a careless grandfather!</paragraph>
