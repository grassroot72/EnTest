   <title>The brown coat</title>

   <paragraph>Mr. Smith has a nice brown coat. He loves it very much. But his wife doesn't like it because it's old. She often says, "Give it to a poor man." But Mr. Smith says, "No, I like this coat."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>But one day, a cigarette falls onto it and makes a hole in it. So Mrs. Smith says, "Please don't wear it again." Mr. Smith takes it to a tailor's shop and says to the tailor, "Please make another coat just like this one." The tailor makes a new coat very carefully, and then he lights a cigarette and makes a hole in it in the same place.</paragraph>
