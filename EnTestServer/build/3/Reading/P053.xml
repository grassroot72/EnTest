   <title>But my birthday is yesterday</title>

   <paragraph>Mr. White is a very busy lawyer. He always works all day. Sometimes he can't have a rest on Sundays, so he usually forgets the date.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Last Saturday, he remembers it is his wife's birthday. "I often forget her birthday," he says to himself, "but not this time." Then he goes to a flower shop and buys some beautiful flowers on his way home.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>When Mr. White gets home, he gives the flowers to Mrs. White and says, "Happy birthday! January 15 is your birthday. I don't forget it this time."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"But my birthday is yesterday. It's January 16 today. Anyway thank you all the same," says Mrs. White.</paragraph>
