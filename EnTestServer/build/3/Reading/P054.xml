   <paragraph>The man wants to buy a cake for himself, but the woman is standing far from the window. It is raining hard and the man doesn't want to go out of the train. Suddenly he sees a boy. The boy is walking on the platform near him. "Come here, boy," the man says, "Do you know how much the cakes cost?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"One dollar for each" the boy answers.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>The man gives the boy two dollors and tells him, "One is for me and the other is for you." A few minutes later, the boy comes back. He is eating a cake. He gives the man one dollar and says, "There is only one cake."</paragraph>
