   <title>The note is still in my pocket</title>

   <paragraph>After Jack buys a piece of meat, the butcher tells him how to cook it. "But I can't remember your words," Jack says. "Will you write them down for me?" The butcher does so.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>With the meat in his hand and the note in his pocket, Jack goes home happily. A dog runs after him on the way. Suddenly it comes at him, takes the meat away from him and runs off. Jack stands there and doesn't know what to do.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Then he laughs and says, "Never mind. You don't know how to eat it. The note is still in my pocket."</paragraph>
