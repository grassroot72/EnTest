   <title>Snow</title>

   <paragraph>It's nine o'clock. But Amy and Tom are still in bed. They like their warm bed. Mother comes in. She says, "Look, children. The world is white." The two children sit up and look out of the window. How nice! There is snow in the garden. There is snow on the trees and on the houses, too. The children are very excited. "We can make a snowman today." the children say.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>So they get up and run out of the house. They want to make snowmen and have snowball fights. Their father will help them.</paragraph>
