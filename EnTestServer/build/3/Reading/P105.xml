   <title>Who is lazy?</title>

   <paragraph>Sam is a lazy boy. One day, his mother says to him, "Sam, look at your sheet! It's too dirty. Would you like to wash it now?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Sam looks at the sheet and then thinks for a while and says, "I don't think it's necessary. I can turn the sheet over. Is that all right?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Sam's mother is very angry at this. "How lazy you are!" she shouts. "I turned it over last week!"</paragraph>
