   <title>My net friend</title>

   <paragraph>I have a computer at home. On the web I make a net friend. He's ten years old. He's in Class Four, Grade Five. He studies very well.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>We often chat in English on the web, and we help each other a lot, so our English improves very quickly.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>In a word, my net friend is a nice boy, and we are good friends.</paragraph>
