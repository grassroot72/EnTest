   <title>Hard cakes</title>

   <paragraph>A man sets out to visit one of his friends early in the morning. He brings some cakes with him for lunch. As he goes along he thinks, "My friend is sure to five me a nice meal." So he throws away the cakes on the road.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>He goes on and finally comes to a river. To his surprise, the river becomes very wide and he can't cross it. He has to wait for a boat. As the sun begins to set, he has to come back.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>He walks and walks and soon he feels very hungry. Suddenly he finds some hard cakes by the roadside. He picks them up happily and eats them all with difficulty.</paragraph>
