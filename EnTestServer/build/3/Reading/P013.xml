   <title>I am a stranger here myself</title>

   <paragraph>Tom is a seaman. He is always drunk. One day Tom goes to a strange city. He drinks very much in a bar that night. When he goes out of the bar, he sees a man lying in the street. The man is quite drunk. When Tom comes nearer, the man points to the sky and asks, "Excuse me, is that the sun or the moon?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Tom looks at the sky for a while and answers, "I'm afraid I can't help you. I am a stranger here myself."</paragraph>
