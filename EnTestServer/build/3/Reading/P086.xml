   <title>Paul's garden</title>

   <paragraph>Paul has a small garden, but it is very nice. There are many beautiful flowers and trees in the garden, so many birds like living in the trees. They're singing there. A dog plays with a cat near the flowers. Paul works hard in the garden.</paragraph>
