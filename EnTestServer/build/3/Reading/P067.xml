   <title>Mike and football games</title>

   <paragraph>Mike likes playing football. So he often watches football games on TV, too. There is a biggest football game on TV at two yesterday. The boy doesn't go to bed and waits for it. At four the game is over. He is very tired and falls asleep.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Jim and Kate get up at six thirty in the morning. But Mike doesn't get up. They go into his bedroom and say, "Get up, Mike, or you will be late for school today."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>But Mike doesn't listen to them. He is still in the bed. Jim sees his glasses and says, "Look, Kate, Mike doesn't take off his glasses! Do you know why?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"He wants to watch a football game more clearly in his dream!" says Kate.</paragraph>
