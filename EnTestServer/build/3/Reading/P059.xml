   <title>Jim and Tim</title>

   <paragraph>Two friends are camping together. Their names are Jim and Tim. Tim is very lazy. The first evening of their holiday, Jim says to Tim, "Here's some money. Go and buy some meat." "I'm too tired," answers Tim. "You go." So Jim goes to buy the meat.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>When he comes back, he says to Tim, "Now, here's the meat. Please cook it." But Tim answers, "No, I'm not good at cooking. You do it." So Jim cooks the meat.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Then Jim says to Tim, "Cut the bread." But Tim answers, "I don't want to." So Jim cuts the bread.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Then he says to Tim, "Go and get some water, please." "No, I don't want to get my clothes dirty," Tim answers, so Jim gets the water.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>At last Jim says, "The meal's ready. Come and eat it." "Well, I'll do that," answers Tim. "I don't like saying 'No' all the time."</paragraph>
