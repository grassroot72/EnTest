   <title>The greedy dog</title>

   <paragraph>A dog gets a nice big piece of meat from a butcher. He has it in his mouth happily. He wants to go home for his lunch. His home is at the other side of the river. There is a bridge over it. He goes on it and looks at the water.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>He sees a dog looking at him and he has a big piece of meat in his mouth, too.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"His meat must be nicer than mine." He thinks greedily. "I must get it." So he opens his mouth and springs on the dog in the water. Before he knows, he loses his meat and it falls into the water.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>I don't like her.</paragraph>
