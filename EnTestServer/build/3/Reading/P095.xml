   <title>I like summer</title>

   <paragraph>Do you know what I like? Summer! I like it because I can go outside to do sports with my friends. If it rains, I can stay inside and play cards. And I like to wear shirts and sandals very much. They're comfortable and cool.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Do you know what I don't like in summer? I don't like homework during summer holidays! I always try to finish it quickly. Then I can have a good time for the next two months!</paragraph>
