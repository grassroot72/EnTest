   <title>My clock</title>

   <paragraph>There is a very nice clock in my bedroom. It is a present from my mother. It is a green snoopy.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>The snoopy has two big ears and a long nose. It wears a blue hat and a red vest. It has a black tie on the neck. Isn't it cool?</paragraph>

   <paragraph>At six in the morning, the clock sings a song to wake me up. At night it tells me to go to bed. With its help, I'm never late for school.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>It is my good friend. I love my clock very much.</paragraph>
