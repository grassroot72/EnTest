   <paragraph>Mr. Brown is not old, but he doesn't have much hair. His wife Linda has thick and black hair.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>They have a son. His name is Peter, and he is five years old.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>One day, Mr. Brown is reading a book in his room. Peter looks at his father for a long time and says to his mother, "Why does Father have so little hair, Mum?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"He has little hair because he thinks a lot. He is a very clever man," Linda says with a smile.</paragraph>
