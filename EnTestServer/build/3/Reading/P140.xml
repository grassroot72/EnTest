   <title>My two good friends</title>

   <paragraph>I have two good friends. They are Alice and Mike. Alice's hair isn't short. Her bag is orange. Her bike is green. She isn't a new pupil. Mike's trousers are orange. His shoes are old. His bike is green, too. He is a new student. Their seats are over there. We often play games after class. And we go home together.</paragraph>
