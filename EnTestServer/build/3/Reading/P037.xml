   <title>A big woman cuts up my ticket</title>

   <paragraph>Tom is a little boy, and he is only seven year old. One day he goes to the cinema. It is the first time for him to do that.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>He buys a ticket and goes in. But after two or three minutes he comes out, buys the second ticket and goes in again. After a few minutes he comes out again and buys the third ticket. Two or three minutes after that he comes out and asks for another ticket. So a girl asks him, "Why do you buy so many tickets? How many friends do you meet?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"No, I have no friends here, but a big woman always stops me at the door and cuts up my ticket."</paragraph>
