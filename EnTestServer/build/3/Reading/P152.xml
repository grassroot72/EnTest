   <title>How to keep healthy?</title>

   <paragraph>"Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise." This is an old English saying. It means that we must go to bed early at night and get early in the morning. Then we will be healthy. We will be rich and clever. The body must have enough sleep to be healthy. Children of young age need ten hours' sleep every night. If people don't have enough sleep, they can't do their work very well. They will not be wise and they may not be wealthy! The body also needs exercise. Walking, running, jumping, swimming and playing games are all exercise. Exercise keeps the body healthy.</paragraph>
