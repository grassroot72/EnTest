   <title>The sun and the wind</title>

   <paragraph>The sun says he is stronger than the wind. The wind says he is stronger than the sun.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>A man is walking down the street with a hat and a coat on.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>The sun says, "Let's see who can make the man take off his hat and coat. If you can do that, you are stronger than me."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Now the wind begins to blow. But the harder he blows, the tighter the man holds his hat and coat. The wind can't make the man take off his hat and coat.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Now the sun tries. He shines brightly. Soon the man takes off his hat. Then the sun shines more brightly, and the man takes off his coat.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>So the wind says, "You are stronger than me."</paragraph>
