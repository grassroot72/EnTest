   <title>My net friend</title>

   <paragraph>I have a computer at home. On the web I make a net friend. He's eleven years old. He's in Class 4, Grade 7. He studies very well.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>We often chat in English on the web. And we help each other a lot. So our English improves very quickly.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>In a word, my net friend is a nice boy, and we are good friends.</paragraph>
