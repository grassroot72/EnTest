   <title>Daydream</title>

   <paragraph>It's a very nice day in May. The students are having a maths class. But Bill is looking out of the window and watching the clouds move across the blue sky. "What a nice day to play football!" he thinks. Just then the bell rings and wakes hime from his daydream. He closes his book sadly, stands up, and walks slowly to his next class.</paragraph>
