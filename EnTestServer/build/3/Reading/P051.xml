   <title>Pay someone to do the work</title>

   <paragraph>Mr. White and his wife decide to paint the outside of their house. To save money they want to do it themselves.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>On Saturday morning they buy some paint and two brushes. They begin with the back of the house that afternoon. The next Saturday Mr. White goes to a football match while his wife paints the front of the house.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>On Sunday they find they can't open any of the front windows. They get them all open in the end, but they break three of the seven and they are every expensive to repair. Next time when they try to save money, they'll certainly pay someone to do the work.</paragraph>
