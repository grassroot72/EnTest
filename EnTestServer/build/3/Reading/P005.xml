   <paragraph>Today is Sunday. I don't go to school. I want to have a bus travel, because my uncle is a bus driver. The bus starts to move. After some time, it stops at a small village. A very old woman comes slowly.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>My uncle wants to wait for her. When she gets on the bus, my uncle is going to close the door. But the old woman says, "Wait a minute. My mother is coming."</paragraph>
