   <title>The longest word in English</title>

   <paragraph>In an English class, the students are working hard at their lessons. Their teacher is very happy. She sings some nice songs with them and she goes to the blackboard and writes "SMILES" on it.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"This is the longest word in English," she says to the class.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>A girl stands up and says, "It has only six letters! Why is it the longest word in English?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>The teacher smiles and says, "Because there is a mile between the first letter and the last."</paragraph>
