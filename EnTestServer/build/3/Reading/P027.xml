   <title>You must stick the stamp on yourself</title>

   <paragraph>Once a Frenchman lives in England. He does not know English very well. One day he goes to the post office with a letter. He buys a stamp. He gives the stamp, together with his letter, to the girl at the desk.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Oh, no," the girl says, "you must stick the stamp on yourself."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>He is very much surprised. He does not believe his ears. "Why must I stick the stamp on myself?" he asks.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Oh," says the girl. "I mean that you must stick the stamp on the letter; you must do it yourself."</paragraph>
