   <title>It is still standing</title>

   <paragraph>Mr. Brown has a big apple tree in his garden with lots of fruit on it. His neighbour, Mr. Smith has an apples tree, too, but there is not much fruit on it.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Mr. Brown is pointing to Mr. Smith tree and laughing. "There aren't many apples on your tree this year," he says. "I've got a lot of fruit on mine."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>But then the wind blows. It is very strong. Mr. Brown's tree falls down and lies on the ground.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Mr. Brown is very sad. But Mr. Smith laughs. "I haven't got much fruit on my tree," he says, "but it is still standing."</paragraph>
