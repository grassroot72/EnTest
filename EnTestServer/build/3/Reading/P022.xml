   <title>Time to wake up</title>

   <paragraph>Mike is at the animal park in Africa. He can see some zebras. They're so cute. They're cuter than the monkeys. They're bigger than the monkeys, too. There are many animals bigger than zebras. Elephants and hippos are both bigger than zebras. Mike can see a lot of elephants.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Look! The elephants are running. The zebras are running, too. The elephants are slower than the zebras. Why are they running? What's that? It's a lion! Mike is runing! The lion is faster than Mike... Oh, no!</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Mike! Time to wake up! Oh! It is a dream.</paragraph>
