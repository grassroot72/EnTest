   <title>It must be your daddy</title>

   <paragraph>One day a sheep is drinking water near the river. A wolf is coming to the sheep. The wolf wants to eat the sheep very much. He says to the sheep. "You make my water dirty. I can't drink it now." The sheep says, "I am far away from you. How can I make your water dirty?" The wolf has nothing to say.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Then the wolf has another idea. He says to the sheep, "Last year you say something bad behind me." The sheep cries, "No, I don't. I am not born at that time."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Then it must be your daddy," the wolf says. Then he rushes at the sheep and eats it.</paragraph>
