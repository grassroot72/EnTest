   <title>Dog's Day</title>

   <paragraph>In Canada, there is a day for dogs. It comes on the second Sunday of October.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Dogs are very helpful to Canadians. They can pull a sled and carry things for people. But on Dog's Day, they don't have to work. They will be dressed up and have a big dinner. Sometimes there is a "Sports Contest" for them.</paragraph>
