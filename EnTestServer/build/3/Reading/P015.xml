   <title>I leave my license at home</title>

   <paragraph>One afternoon it is hot. Andy is driving his car in the street. When he is coming near the crossing, he suddenly remembers something and gets off at once. He begins to push his car in the street. It makes the policeman surprised and he asks, "What's the matter with your car, sir?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Nothing, sir," answers Andy.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"But why push it, then?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Because I leave my license at home."</paragraph>
