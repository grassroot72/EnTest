   <title>Our faces turn very red</title>

   <paragraph>One day, my wife and I go shopping because my brother and his family are going to spend the weekend with us. We take the car as we have a lot of things to buy. We stop the car in front of the shop. An hour later we come back to the car with a lot of things. Then the trouble starts. We can not open the car door.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Oh, dear," says my wife. "What are we going to do?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Let's ask the policeman," I say.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>The policeman is very kind and glad to help us. Soon he gets the door open. Just as that moment an angry man comes up and shouts. "What are you going to do with my car?" We look at the number of the car, and our faces turn very red.</paragraph>
