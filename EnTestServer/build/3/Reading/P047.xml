   <title>A snow angel</title>

   <paragraph>New York has its first snow this winter. It's all white outside. Miss Green has to be at home all day. When she wants to take her dog out for a walk, she opens the door and finds there is no snow in front of her house. "Who cleans it for me?" she says.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>A week later, there comes a second snow. Miss Green wants to find out who cleans the snow for her. But she is too busy and forgets to do that.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>For the third snow, Miss Green opens her door and sits in the front of her house. At last, she sees a little boy cleaning the snow in front of her house. He is really a snow angel.</paragraph>
