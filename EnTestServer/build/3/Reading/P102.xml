   <title>The colour of autumn</title>

   <paragraph>Autumn comes, and it gets cooler and cooler. The sky is blue and the clouds are white. You would say autumn is blue and white.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Look! Birds are flying from the north to the south. The leaves are yellow. Some are hanging on the trees; some are on the ground; some are dancing in the wind. Someone would say autumn is yellow.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>There are so many fruits in autumn, pears, peaches, mangoes, oranges and so on. They're fresh.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Oh! I see. Autumn is a harvest season. Autumn is colourful. What a beautiful season!</paragraph>
