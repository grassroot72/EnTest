   <title>The gold watch</title>

   <paragraph>When a boy is taking his father's meal to the factory, he stops for a moment to watch a worker cleaning the sewer.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>The boy says, "My mother drops her gold watch down here yesterday."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>The worker's eyes becomes wide. "Well, my boy," he says. "Get along with you."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>An hour later, the boy comes back. "Are you sure there is a gold watch here?" asks the worker.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"I'm quite sure," answers the boy with a smile. "Because I see my father get it out. I see it with my own eyes."</paragraph>
