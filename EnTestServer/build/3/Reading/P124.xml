   <title>Watching TV</title>

   <paragraph>Most children like to watch TV. It is very interesting. By watching TV they can see and learn a lot and know many things about their country and the world. Of course, they can also learn over the radio. But they can learn better and more easily with TV. Why? Because they can hear and watch at the same time. But they can't see anything over the radio.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Many children watch TV only on Saturday and Sunday evenings. They are always busy with their lessons. But some children watch TV every night. They go to bed very late. They can't have a good rest. How about you, my young friend?</paragraph>
