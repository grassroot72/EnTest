   <title>We need sleep</title>

   <paragraph>During the day we work and play, and at night we sleep. Our bodies rest while we sleep. In the morning we are ready to work and play again.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Our bodies grow most while we are asleep. Boys and girls need ten hours of sleep every night. Our bodies need plenty of air when we sleep. If we do not get enough fresh air, we will feel tired when we wake up.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>While in bed we must not cover our heads. Our lungs need to et enough fresh air. If we open our windows at night, we can have plenty of fresh air in. Cool air is better than warm air. If boys and girls want to be strong, they must get plenty of sleep.</paragraph>
