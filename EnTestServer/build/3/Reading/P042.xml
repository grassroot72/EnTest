   <title>School isn't very bad</title>

   <paragraph>Mrs. Jones is a teacher. Her house is not far from her school, and she always walks there in the morning. All the pupils in the school are very young.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Mrs. Jones walks to school on a very cold and windy morning in October, and the cold wind goes into her eyes, and big tears begin running out of them. She reaches the school, opens the door and goes into the classroom.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>It is nice and warm there and Mrs. Jones is happy. But then a small boy looks at her for a few seconds, puts his arms round her and says kindly, "Don't cry, miss. School isn't very bad."</paragraph>
