   <title>What time is it?</title>

   <paragraph>John is six year old. He can read and write well, but he can't tell the time. He doesn't say eight o'clock , twelve o'clock, or four o'clock in the afternoon. He says breakfast-time, lunch-time or tea-time.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>His aunt thinks she can teach him.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Can you count, John?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Yes, One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve..."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"That's fine. Now, look at the clock, I put the long hand on twelve and the short hand on one - this is one o'clock. If I put the short hand on two, what's that?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Two o'clock."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Good. And on three?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Three o'clock."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Very good, boy. Now the short hand is on four," John's aunt looks at him and asks, "What time is it, John?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Tea-time, Aunt, and I'm hungry."</paragraph>
