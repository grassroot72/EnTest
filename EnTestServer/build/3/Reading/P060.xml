   <title>My nose bleeds</title>

   <paragraph>One day a boy is walking along the street. Suddenly he stops and looks up into the sky. A young man passes by him. When he sees the boy, he feels curious and looks up, too. Just then a girl comes up and sees them. "Is there anything strange in the sky?" she thinks and looks up, too.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>After a while, there are quite a lot people. They are interested in the clear blue sky. Suddenly the boy asks, "Hey, what are all of you looking up at?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"We are just going to ask you," says the young man.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"You want to ask me? But I am not looking at anything," says the boy, "I raise my head upward because my nose bleeds."</paragraph>
