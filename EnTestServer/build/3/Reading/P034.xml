   <title>A great runner</title>

   <paragraph>Once a great boxer, Tom Brown, goes to a restaurant for dinner. He takes off his coat and leaves it at the door. But he is afraid that somebody will take it. So he gets a piece of paper and writes the following words on it: "The great boxer, Tom Brown, leaves his coat here; he will come back in a few minutes."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>He puts the paper on his coat and goes to have his dinner. When he returns, his coat isn't there, but he finds a piece of paper in its place. It says: "A great runner takes away your coat, and he will not come back at all!"</paragraph>
