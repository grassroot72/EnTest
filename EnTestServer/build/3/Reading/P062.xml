   <title>The lion and the crocodile</title>

   <paragraph>When I am a young man. I once travel in the north of a country.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>One evening, it is getting dark and I am walking alone on a small road beside a forest. On my right is a river; on my left, the thick, dark forest. Suddenly I see two green eyes looking at me in the forest. A big lion is trying to jump on me.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>What can I do? Should I jump into the river and hope to save my life by swimming? I look at the river. There is a big crocodile in it. Its mouth is open. I am so frightened that I close my eyes. I hear the leaves of trees moving as the lion jumps. I open my eyes. What do you think happens? The lion jumps over me and now is in the mouth of the crocodile.</paragraph>
