   <title>Spring</title>

   <paragraph>Spring is coming. Spring is the first season of the year. In China, Spring comes in February. It is still cold, but it is getting warmer and warmer. The days get longer and longer. The leaves on the trees begin to turn green. Then they come up green leaves in the spring wind. Spring is also a sowing season.</paragraph>
