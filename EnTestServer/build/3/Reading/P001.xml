   <title>The sun</title>

   <paragraph>What a fine day it is! The sun is shining and everything looks bright. The sun gives heat from very far away. The sun looks small because it is so far from us, but it's really very big.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>The sun gives us light. It keeps us warm. It makes things grow. Plants, animals and people need the sun. We can't live without the sun.</paragraph>
