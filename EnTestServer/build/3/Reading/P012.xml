   <title>Where is the fish?</title>

   <paragraph>A cat goes fishing by the river every day, but he can't catch any fish.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>One day, he goes to the river as usual. Suddenly a fish comes out. He catches the fish. He is so happy that he forgets to put the fish into the basket. He dances and sings. He shouts, "I have a fish! I have a fish!" All his friends come to see him. "Where is your fish? Let us have a look at it." his frirends say.</paragraph>
   
   <paragraph>"It's there, near the bank." the cat answers. But he can't find the fish. When he sings and dances, the fish jumps back into the river.</paragraph>
