   <title>He's sitting and laughing at me</title>

   <paragraph>George is a young man. He does not have a wife, but he has a very big dog, and he has a very small car too. He likes playing tennis. Last Monday he plays tennis for an hour at a club, and then he runs out and jumps into a car. His dog comes after him, but it does not jump into the same car. It jumps into the next one.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Come here, silly dog!" George shouts at it but the dog stays in the other car.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>George puts his key into the lock of the car, but the key does not turn. Then he looks at the car again. It is not his! He is in the wrong car! And the dog is in the right one! "He's sitting and laughing at me!" George says angrily. But then he smiles and gets into his car with the dog.</paragraph>
