   <title>I want to go out</title>

   <paragraph>Bill goes into a restaurant when it's eight in the evening. He asks some drinks and soon begins to sleep. When he wakes up in the midnight, he can't find any people in the restaurant. The door is closed and he can't go out. He finds a telephone number on a piece of paper and begins to call Mr. Jackson, the owner of the restaurant.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Hello," says the boy. "When do you open your restaurant, Mr. Jackson?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Mr. Jackson isn't happy. So he says, "Don't ask me about that. I won't let you in."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Oh, no! I want to go out!"</paragraph>
