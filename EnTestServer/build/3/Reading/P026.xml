   <title>The little clever monkey</title>

   <paragraph>A little monkey picks up a pumpkin and wants to take it home. But the pumpkin is too big. The monkey can't take it home.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Suddenly he see a panda riding a bike towards him. He watches the bike. "I have a good idea. I can roll the pumpkin. It is like a wheel."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>So he rolls the pumpkin to his home. When his mother sess the big pumpkin, she is surprised and says, "How can you carry it home?" The little monkey answers proudly, "I can't lift it, but I can roll it." His mother smiles and says, "What a clever boy!"</paragraph>
