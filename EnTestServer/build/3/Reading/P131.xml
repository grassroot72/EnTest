   <title>A clever fox</title>

   <paragraph>A lion says that he is sick. He stays at home all day long. The animals in the forest hear about this. They all come to see the lion. But he is not sick at all. He eats them all.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>A fox also comes to see the lion. He comes to the door of the lion's house. Then he finds all the footprints are towards the house. Soon he understands all things. He runs away quickly. The lion doesn't see him.</paragraph>
