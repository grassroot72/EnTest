   <title>Is that clock right?</title>

   <paragraph>Dan is the doorman of a club in a big city. Every day, thousands of people pass the door, and a lot of them stop and say to him, "What's the time, please?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>After a few months, Dan says to himself, "I'm not going to answer all those stupid people any more. I'm going to a shop and buy a big clock. Then I'm going to put it up on the wall here."</paragraph>

   <paragraph>He buys a clock and puts it up on the wall.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Now people aren't going to stop and ask me the time," he says happily. But after that, a lot of people stop every day, look at the clock and say to Dan, "Is that clock right?"</paragraph>
