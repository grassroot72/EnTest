   <title>What colours are their T-shirts?</title>

   <paragraph>Mary, Ben, Eric and Joe put their T-shirts on the bed. The T-shirts are white, blue, red and black. The boys' T-shirts aren't red and the girls' T-shirts aren't black.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>What colour is Mary's T-shirt? I don't know. But I know it is not blue. Ben says, "My T-shirt is white." Then what colours are their T-shirts?</paragraph>
