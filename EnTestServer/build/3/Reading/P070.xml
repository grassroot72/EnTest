   <title>Hank's car</title>

   <paragraph>Hank lives in a small town. One day he finds a job in a big city. So he moves there with his wife and his two children.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>On the first Saturday in their new house, Hank takes his new red car out of the garage and begins to wash it. A neighbour stops and says, "What a nice car! Is it yours?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Sometimes," Hank answers.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>The neighbor is surprise, "Sometimes? What do you mean?"</paragraph>

   <paragraph>"Well," answers Hank, "when there's a party in the town, it's my daughter's. When there's a football game somewhere, it's my son's. When I washes it, and it looks nice and clean, it's my wife's. And when it needs gas, it's mine."</paragraph>
