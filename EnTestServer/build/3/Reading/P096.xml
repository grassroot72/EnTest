   <title>Trees Planting Day</title>

   <paragraph>March 12th is Trees Planting Day. Many people go out to plant trees. They plant trees on hills, in the parks or along the roads. First, they dig holes, then put young trees into the holes and put the earth back. At last, they water the young trees. They know trees are people's friends. They will take good care of them.</paragraph>
