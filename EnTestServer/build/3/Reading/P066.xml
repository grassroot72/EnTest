   <title>Jack can stand it on longer</title>

   <paragraph>My friend, Dick, has a large police dog. Its name is Jack. Every Saturday afternoon Dick takes Jack for a long walk in the park. Jack likes these long walks very much.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>One afternoon, a young man comes to visit my friend. He stays a long time. He talks and talks. Soon it is time for my friend to take Jack for a walk. But the man is still there.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>Jack becomes very worried. He walks around the room several times and then sits down in front of the man and looks at him. But the man keeps talking. Finally Jack can stand it no longer. He goes out of the room and comes back a few minutes later. He sits down again in front of the man, but this time he holds the man's hat in his mouth.</paragraph>
