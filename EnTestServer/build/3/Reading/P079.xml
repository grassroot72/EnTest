   <title>Our school</title>

   <paragraph>Look! That is our school. It is very nice. There are many trees and many flowers in the garden. Our school is not big. There are twelve classes in our school. There are about fifty students in every class. We have forty teachers and we have one headmaster. The headmaster is Liu Ming.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>In class, we listen to our teachers carefully. We study hard. After class, we often play basketball or football. Our school life is very colourful. We like our school, our headmaster, our teachers and our class.</paragraph>
