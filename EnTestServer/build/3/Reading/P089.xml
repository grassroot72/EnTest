   <title>The twins' bedroom</title>

   <paragraph>Sara and Nora are twin sisters. This is their bedroom. It's a nice room.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>The two beds are in the same colour. They are orange. This is Sara's bed. Her yellow T-shirt is on it. That bed is Nora's. Her blue trousers are on it. Their desks are in the same colour, too. They are near their beds. And two chairs are beside the beds.</paragraph>
